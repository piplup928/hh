## Overview of TOHG
<div align="justify">

Text-to-Online Handwriting Generation (TOHG) refers to the task of synthesizing realistic pen trajectories $(G_i)$ conditioned on textual content $(T)$ and style reference $(S_i)$.

## DiffInk vs. Character–Layout Decoupled Approaches
<div align="justify">

(a) A two-stage pipeline combining handwritten font generation with layout post-processing; (b) **DiffInk (Ours)**, which takes text and a style reference to directly output complete text lines. Unlike the two-stage pipeline, DiffInk generates more natural character connections rather than mechanically stitching bounding boxes.

## Usage

### Install

- Create environment:: `conda create -n diffink python=3.8 -y`
- Install dependencies: `conda activate diffink && pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Data and Pretrained Weights

Download the dataset and pretrained weights from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h_uLmn-55WmbSBGh1ES8-rftAbDs8riB?usp=drive_link) or [Baidu Cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1NhEoO_hIDOn2dC4qN1oe1A?pwd=ddra).

### Training

- Train the **InkVAE** model with: `bash scripts/train_vae_ddp.sh`

- Then, train the **InkDiT** model with: `bash scripts/train_dit_ddp.sh`

- Finally, fine-tune the model on real data with: `bash scripts/tune_dit_ddp.sh`

### Inference

Run inference with: `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python val_dit.py`
